        <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Writing research articles is one of the most important parts of the academic life, given the “publish or perish” situation that every researcher must face.<br>However, submitting and tracking your manuscript can be an uncomfortable experience due to the complicated post-submission (i.e., peer-review) process. Even though journals provide online platforms for authors to check the status of their submissions, the authors may not understand what happens to their submitted manuscripts, mainly because of (1) incorrectly updated status, and (2) weird status transitions. The first situation is usually resulted from human mistakes such as the associate editor’s obliviation, the reviewers’ unpunctuality, etc. We can do nothing but to tolerate, because “to human is err.” Nevertheless, even an adept researcher may become confused with the second situation due to the lack of a systematic understanding of the peer-review process. For newbie researchers, the weird status transitions are not only confusing but also upsetting. </p>
<p>In this essay, I would like to give a detailed analysis of peer-review process, which helps you rationally guess what happens to your submission. I also validate my workflow diagram by analyzing several cases of “weird” status transitions.</p>
<h2 id="Who-handles-your-manuscript"><a href="#Who-handles-your-manuscript" class="headerlink" title="Who handles your manuscript?"></a>Who handles your manuscript?</h2><p>People hold different responsibilities for your submission. In general, the peer-review consists of the internal and external reviews. Editors performs the internal reviews, whereas reviewers, the external ones. </p>
<h3 id="Editor"><a href="#Editor" class="headerlink" title="Editor"></a>Editor</h3><p>An editor or editor-in-chief (EiC) decide whether accept or reject your manuscript. At the very beginning, the EiC roughly reviews your manuscript to determine whether it is worthy for further (i.e., external) reviews. If so, the EiC will assign an associate editor to handle your manuscript; otherwise, the EiC will reject your manuscript. </p>
<h3 id="Associate-editor"><a href="#Associate-editor" class="headerlink" title="Associate editor"></a>Associate editor</h3><p>An associate editor (AE) handles your manuscript by inviting external reviewers and making evaluation recommemdation based on the review reports. Note that the AE only makes recommendations to the EiC, who will make the final decisions based on the recommendations. Because the AE cannot reveal his/her recommendations to the author, any decision-like words (accepted, rejected, major revision, etc) that displays in the status-tracking platform must be under the approval of the EiC, regardless of the terminologies (evaluation result, decision, etc).</p>
<h3 id="Reviewer-s"><a href="#Reviewer-s" class="headerlink" title="Reviewer(s)"></a>Reviewer(s)</h3><p>Reviewers are invited by the AE to review your manuscript. </p>
<h2 id="Peer-review-process"><a href="#Peer-review-process" class="headerlink" title="Peer-review process"></a>Peer-review process</h2><p>In academia, scholarly peer review is used to evaluate an academic paper’s suitability for publication. The process usually involves one to four reviewers according to several factors such as the type of the manuscript (letter or full length paper, etc). Sometimes more reviewers will be invited when the AEs cannot make recommendations based on the review reports provided by the current reviewers.</p>
<h3 id="Status"><a href="#Status" class="headerlink" title="Status"></a>Status</h3><p>During the peer-review process, your submission will go through several status that indicates what is happening to the manuscript. Comprehending the meanings of status is crucial to track your submission. However, the terminologies varies among journals, preventing me from enumerating the status. Instead, I will give a general workflow diagram to help your understand the peer-review process.</p>
<h3 id="General-workflow"><a href="#General-workflow" class="headerlink" title="General workflow"></a>General workflow</h3><p><img src="/2020/07/07/What-happens-to-your-submitted-manuscript/prw.jpg" alt><br>Figure 1. Detailed workflow diagram of peer-review process.</p>
<h2 id="Case-analyses"><a href="#Case-analyses" class="headerlink" title="Case analyses"></a>Case analyses</h2><p>In this section, I chose three cases from the Q&amp;A forum of the website “editage.com.”<br>Q1: What is the meaning of “Required reviews completed” back to “Under review”?<br>Description: I submitted my paper to the journal ***. After a month, I received comments from three reviewers requesting minor revisions. I edited my manuscript as they suggested and submitted the revised version. After 3 weeks my paper status was changed to “Required reviews completed” but after a day it was changed to “Under review” again. Could you guide me what it means and is it possible the reviewers reject it despite their first opinions?<br>Analysis: according to Fig. 1, we can guess such a situation occurred because the AE could not get sufficient information from the REQUIRED COMPLETED REVIEW reports to make an evaluation recommendation, and thus invited more reviewers to review the manuscript.</p>
